# Shed

This is my contribution to the AI community. 

It seems open-web ui does not care to put gemini as a first class citizen in connections. https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/discussions/3660

This is just plain wrong and unfair. So I am building my own, and I hope you will join me and it us.

Under construction :construction: 

## Features
- Built in good languages: (Go, Javascript, and Vue3)
- 
- Completely free forever

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ds0nt/shed

```


## What is Shed?

Shed is a web app that is just another web ui for LLMs.

This one is written in Go and Vue3 javascript, so if those are your favorite languages, please join in the fun.
