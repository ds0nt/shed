# shed
A web ui that connects with every ai provider possible. Built using JS, and Golang, in a practical manner. Similar to all the other ones, but without typescript.

## Providers In Mind

### Chat
- Ollama
- OpenAI
- Mistral
- Gemini
- lots of stuff I don't know about yet

### I like TTS so we should integrate with some TTS providers too


More to come this weekend. (also accepting contributions)
